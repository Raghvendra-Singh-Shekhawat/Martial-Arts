    <p>The evolution of the martial arts has been described by historians in the context of countless historical battles.

      Dhanurveda, a section found in the Vedas contains references to martial arts. Around the 3rd century BC, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali taught how to meditate single-mindedly on points located inside one's body, which was
      later used in martial arts, while various mudra finger movements were taught in Yogacara Buddhism. These elements of yoga, as well as finger movements in the nata dances, were later incorporated into various martial arts.

      Indian martial arts were an important influence in the development of a number of modern Asian martial arts, particularly within the Indian cultural sphere (countries outside India influenced by Indian culture and religion) of Southeast Asia.
      Examples include Indo-Malay silat, Burmese banshay, naban and bando,Filipino escrima and kali, Thai krabi krabong and Cambodian bokator. Indian martial arts also lightly influenced the various forms of Indochinese kickboxing,
      namely Muay Thai from Thailand, Muay Lao from Laos, Tomoi from Malaysia, Pradal Serey from Cambodia and Lethwei from Myanmar.</p>
